# ML Algorithms (from scratch)

This repository contains implementations of classic machine learning algorithms from scratch, using only the libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Algorithms Implemented
- KNN
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means
- AdaBoost
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Notes
- Each algorithm will be implemented without using high-level ML frameworks.
- Only dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` will be used.
